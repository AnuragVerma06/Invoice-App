🧠 Tech Stack

    Framework: Vue 3 with Composition API

    State: Vuex for state management

    Database: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL, real‑time)

    (Optional) Auth: Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google, etc.)

    Styling: CSS or Sass (depending on original tutorial)

🧭 App Flow Overview

    State store (Vuex):

        invoices module: holds list of invoices, CRUD actions

        (Optional) auth module: handles sign‑in, sign‑out, persists user state

    Views:

        Dashboard: shows invoices, allows filtering/sorting.

        Invoice form: for creating or editing invoice items.

        Invoice detail: view and print invoice.

    Main logic:

        Firestore observers sync on changes (add, update, delete).

        Vuex actions dispatch Firebase calls to persist data.

        Components subscribe to store state and dispatch mutations.

📦 Deployment

You can deploy via platforms like Firebase Hosting, Vercel, or Netlify:

    Firebase Hosting: preferred if you're already using Firestore.

    Static Export: use npm run build and host the dist/ folder.

🧩 Customization Ideas

    Add user authentication, multi-user support, and invoice isolation.

    Enhance styling using Tailwind CSS or other frameworks.

    Integrate PDF export or printing functionality.

    Connect to a serverless backend or Stripe for invoice payments.

    Use Pinia as a modern alternative to Vuex if refactoring.
